## INTRODUCTION
  Consider a sequence of n trees { T0, T1, T2, T3, ..., Tn }. From T0, a monkey can swing to the next adjacent tree (T1). 
  It can also swing to other succeeding trees (T2 or T3 or ...) provided that the trees in the middle are shorter than both T0 and the target tree. 
  Suppose that tree heights = 10, 15, and 20 feet. The following are possible pairs of trees that the monkey can swing
  
 ## REQUIREMENTS
# 1. The program must at least
    1.1 Get number of trees (at least 3) and the height of each tree from user
    1.2 Given the tree arrangement in (1.1), report all possible tree-pairs and the total number of pairs
  
# 2. Design a better user interface

# 3. Data Structure
    There are many approaches to solving this problem. Using brute force (i.e. checking all possible pairs of trees) is one of them. But you should research and implement a better solution.
    
    MY SOLUTION THE DATA STRUCTURE USING STACK
    
# 4. Exception handling
